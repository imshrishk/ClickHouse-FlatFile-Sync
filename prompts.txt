I am making a configuration page for connecting to ClickHouse. It should allow the user to the below
Enhnace my code so that it works
Select protocol (http/https) from a dropdown.
Input host, port, username, and either password or JWT token (with a toggle option).
This configuration should remain same and must be used for all future requests unless changed.
(Also tell me what I am doing wrong with the following logs so that I can fix and add the above)

this should be the upload section as below
After file selection, allow preview of first 100 rows with user-specified delimiter.(done but enhance it)
Show parsed column names with checkboxes to select columns for upload. Must be for multiple
show a name input and dropdowns to choose data types
Upload progress bar should display:
blue progress bar above the “Upload to ClickHouse” button with percentage uploaded and size
After upload completes show me specifically how much was added.

User can selet table from dropdown, like enums
Fetches and displays columns (with checkboxes as was previously used)
Allows user to input a custom delimiter (like , / \ | ` ~ or any thing symbol only).
“Use multiple tables” toggle opens table join builder:
For each join user can select table, join type (INNER, LEFT, etc.), and join conditions using column dropdowns.
Add preview button that shows results in a modal.
Download should call /api/clickhouse/download and show a progress bar (like upload).
Show Content-Length size and percentage clearly.

I have made basic UI, enhance it. Give me plans on how you want to do it and I will select from it.
Note that all the plans must be modern and the list of plans must be over 3. Also state the components you
plan to use. Preferred is shadCN.

Enhance the code with proper and detailed comments so anyone can easily understand what is going on.
Make README and .gitignore for it too.

Add additional tests to it than the one present. Also validate if the existing tests are good. make 
sure to account for edge cases too
